# Advent-of-Code-2025

During this Christmas Season, I want to continue to keep up my programming and problem solving skills. I will be taking on the Advent of Code challenges 2025. 

My aim this year is to try to complete all the challenges by December!

I will be trying to get familiar with Go so I am going to tackle all the challenges in Go. The folder is structured so that for each day I can just change the main.go file 

```go
package main

func main() {
    dayX()
}
```

Then in each of the dayX.go file I will have the solution. I have a fetch module that will fetch the input if not found in the input folder.

This is just a hobby of mine and not a professional competitive format. I am doing this for fun and to keep my skills sharp.
